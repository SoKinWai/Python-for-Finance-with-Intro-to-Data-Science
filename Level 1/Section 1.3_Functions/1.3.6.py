#Mean fuction
#This function takes in a list, a tuple or variable numbers of arguments
# of ints and/or floatsï¼ˆList) as its input parameter and calculates the average of all
#the entries of the input list. The function then returns the calculated average
def argsMean(*args):
    # Calculate the average of a list, a tuple or variable numbers of arguments
    # by taking the sum of all its elements and dividing it by the length of the list, the tuple or the variable numbers of arguments.
    # Then returns the resulting average
    return sum(args) / len(args)
