#Average() Function
#This function takes in a list of ints and/or floatsï¼ˆList) as its input parameter and calculates the average of all
#the entries of the input list. The function then returns the calculated average
def Average(List):
    #Calculate the average of List by taking the sum of all its elements and dividing it by the length of the List.
    #Then return the resulting average
    return (sum(List) / len(List))

#Variance function
#This function takes in a list of ints and/or floats(List) as its input paremeter and calculates the variance of
#all entries of the input List. The function then returns the calculated variance on screen
def get_variance(List):
    #Calcualte the variance of List by taking the sum of all its emememts minus the mean and dividing it by the length of the List.
    #Then print the resulting variance
    return sum((i - Average(List)) ** 2 for i in List) / len(List)
